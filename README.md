# 📚 Library Fine Calculator (C++)

A simple console-based Library Fine Calculator built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++.  
This program helps libraries automatically calculate overdue fines and generate a formatted receipt for transparency.

## 📌 Project Description

Managing overdue book fines manually can lead to calculation errors and delays.  
This project automates the fine calculation process using predefined rules and structured programming.

The system collects member details, calculates the fine based on overdue days, and displays a formatted receipt.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Accepts member name and book details.
- Records due date and return date.
- Calculates fine automatically.
- Applies tiered fine structure.
- Displays formatted receipt.
- Uses Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- Clean and modular code design.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Class & Object**
- **Encapsulation (private data members)**
- **Public member functions**
- **Constructor for initialization**
- **Conditional logic for fine calculation**

## 💰 Fine Calculation Rules

| Overdue Days  | Fine Rate   |
|-------------- |------------ |
| 0 days        | No fine     |
| 1 – 5 days    | ₹5 per day  |
| 6 – 10 days   | ₹10 per day |
| Above 10 days | ₹20 per day |

## ⚙️ Program Flow

1. User enters member and book details  
2. System records overdue days  
3. Fine is calculated using conditional logic  
4. Receipt is displayed with all details
